## Grading

Your grade in this class will be broken down into several categories. 

* Homework - 20%
* Tests - 20% (There will be 2)
* Projects - 40% (There will be 2)
* Final Project - 20%

Homework will be small assignments that are meant to make sure that you are working with the content of the course and 
learning the terms and ideas that are essential in the course. Tests will be an opportunity to show that you have 
facility with the ideas and vocabulary that is necessary for us to understand and write robot code. Projects will be more complex tasks
that will show your ability to break down larger problems and work through a design and revision process. 
The final project will be a place for you to give back to the team and leave or documentation, a challenge, or application 
that the team can use in the future to improve our programming skill.
