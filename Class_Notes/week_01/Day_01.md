## Introduction to Python

To get started writing a python program you can open a new project in PyCharm called 'CS570_Day_1'. 

* Show students basics of Python
  * How to make a function using def
  * How ```__name__ == "__main__"``` works
  * How to run a program in PyCharm
  * How to run the debugger in PyCharm

## Introduction to git and GitHub

* What is git
  * It is a method of version control. 
  * Version Control is a way to make changes but not lose what you had previously done.
    * Many times in writing a program you want to change things that work now, so that they work better.
    * You have to break to build it.
  * git has a way to putting landmarks in your changes called "commits"
  * You make a commit when you have made something complete and every commit comes with a message about what you did
  * git also is helpful for having several people work together on the same project
  * we do this through the idea of "branches" different people work on different branches and then are able to merge their code together when they are done
  * Let's do an example:
* GitHub is a place that records the git changes that happen to a project and make the sharing of information possible.
* GitHub is a place where you can share your progress on a project and then merge it with other's work.

## Breaking projects into separate files and branching

Two ideas come together to make git and GitHub and Python work so seamlessly together. Object-Oriented Programming and branches.

* Introduce OOP
* Introduce Branching
