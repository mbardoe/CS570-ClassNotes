# Class Notes for CS570

This repository is for the class notes for CS570 at Choate Rosemary Hall 
in the Spring of 2023. The course goals are to give students background in 
writing code for FRC robots that will allow them to write 
autonomous routines. In the process of achieving that goal students will
also learn important ideas about the following:

* using git and GitHub to manage code development
* writing code in Python
* Object-Oriented Programming ideas
* Learn to use wpilib to complete a skeleton of a functioning robot
* Writing tests for code written for a robot

## Structure of the Notes

There are a variety of folders in the repo. 

* Class_Organization: Syllabus and grading policy
